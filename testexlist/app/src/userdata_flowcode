1 User opens App


2a User chooses not to sign in

If user declines to sign in > data is stored in local SQLite db

When app is loaded check for a flag that tells us if the user is signed in







2b User creates account and signs in

Data is immediately store in the cloud
User account to access that data is stored locally
When user signs out the account is deleted


Maybe we can check to see if Table of DB has been initialized with a user account
